# PACKAGE_MANAGEMENT.md - Package Scripts & Dependencies

**[USER CONFIGURATION REQUIRED]**

This file documents package management, npm/pnpm/yarn scripts, and dependency management strategies. Agents reference this file when they need to understand build tools and package operations.

## üì¶ Package Manager

**Purpose**: Document which package manager is used and why.

**What to include**:

**Example**:
```
Package Manager: [pnpm 8.x / npm 10.x / yarn 4.x / bun 1.x]

Why this choice:
- [Performance benefits / Disk space efficiency / Team preference]

Installation:
- Install: [npm install -g pnpm@8 / brew install pnpm]
- Verify: [pnpm --version]

Lock File: [pnpm-lock.yaml / package-lock.json / yarn.lock / bun.lockb]
- Committed to git: Yes

3. Update in development branch
4. Run full test suite
5. Test in staging environment
6. Deploy to production

Automated Updates:
- Tool: [Dependabot / Renovate / None]
- Auto-merge: [Security patches only / Never]

## ‚ö° Performance & Optimization

**Purpose**: Document package-related performance optimizations.

**What to include**:
- Bundle size targets
- Lazy loading strategies
- Code splitting patterns
- Dependency optimization

**Example**:
```
Bundle Size Targets:
- Main bundle: <[500]KB (gzipped)
- Vendor bundle: <[300]KB (gzipped)
- Individual routes: <[200]KB (gzipped)

Optimization Strategies:
- Dynamic imports for large dependencies
- Tree shaking enabled for all libraries
- Minimize use of large utility libraries (prefer specific imports)
- Regular bundle analysis to catch regressions

Code Splitting:
- Route-based: Automatic via [framework]
- Component-based: Manual via dynamic imports
- Libraries: Vendor chunk separate from app code

Dependency Optimization:
- Use [lodash-es] instead of [lodash] for tree shaking
- Replace large libraries with smaller alternatives:
  * [moment] ‚Üí [date-fns] (saved [XKB])
  * [Library] ‚Üí [Alternative] (saved [XKB])
```

## üìù Configuration Guide

**To populate this file**:

1. Document scripts as you add them to package.json
2. Update dependency sections when adding major dependencies
3. Review and update quarterly or when build setup changes
4. Keep bundle size targets updated based on actual measurements

**When agents reference this file**:
- code-writing-agent uses it to understand build commands and dependencies
- testing-agent uses it to run appropriate test commands
- debugging-agent uses it to understand build configuration
- planning-agent uses it to understand development environment constraints
