üîç QUALITY CHECK RESULTS:
   pnpm lint now runs: ESLint ‚Üí Typecheck ‚Üí Unit Tests

‚ÑπÔ∏è  CONTEXT:

- ESLint: Should be clean (Level 1 blocks on lint errors)
- Typecheck: Should be clean (Level 1 blocks on type errors)
- Tests: Should be passing (Level 1 blocks on test failures)

üí° RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. If ANY issues present: Investigate why Level 1 didn't catch them
2. This indicates a potential gap in the Level 1 quality gate
3. Review code-writing-agent output for quality gate execution
4. Run 'pnpm lint' for complete quality check output
5. Run individual checks to isolate issues:
   - 'pnpm lint:only' (ESLint only)
   - 'pnpm typecheck' (TypeScript only)
   - 'pnpm test:run' (Tests only)

üìä QUALITY GATE SYSTEM:

- Level 1 (code-writing-agent): BLOCKS on all quality issues (eslint + typecheck + tests)
- Level 2 (code-reviewer): INFORMATIONAL guidance (this hook - should see clean results)
- Level 3 (critique-agent): Evidence validation at completion

See /specs/active/three-level-quality-gate-system.yml for details.
