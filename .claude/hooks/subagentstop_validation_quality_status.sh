üö® COMPLETION DECISION IMPACT:

‚õî TYPE ERRORS DETECTED - TASK COMPLETION MUST BE BLOCKED

According to the three-level quality gate system:
- Level 1: code-writing-agent and testing-agent should block on type errors
- Level 2: code-reviewer provides informational guidance
- Level 3: critique-and-validation-agent MUST NOT approve completion with type errors

‚úÖ REQUIRED ACTIONS FOR COMPLETION:

1. All type errors MUST be fixed before task can be marked COMPLETE
2. If Level 1 agents completed despite type errors, this indicates a hook bypass
3. critique-and-validation-agent MUST set completion status to INCOMPLETE
4. Return to code-writing-agent or testing-agent to fix type errors
5. Re-run validation after fixes are applied

üìä COMPLETION CRITERIA:

For task completion approval, critique-and-validation-agent requires:
‚úÖ Application typecheck: MUST be clean (MANDATORY)
‚úÖ Testing infrastructure typecheck: MUST be clean (MANDATORY)
üí° Application lint: Noted if issues present (ADVISORY)
üí° Testing infrastructure lint: Noted if issues present (ADVISORY)

‚ö†Ô∏è  CURRENT STATUS: COMPLETION BLOCKED DUE TO TYPE ERRORS

- Specification: /specs/active/three-level-quality-gate-system.yml
- Documentation: AGENTS.md sections on quality gates
- Hook system: Three-level quality enforcement architecture

‚úÖ TYPE SAFETY VALIDATED - COMPLETION MAY PROCEED

According to the three-level quality gate system:
- Typecheck: CLEAN (completion not blocked)
- Lint issues: PRESENT but ADVISORY (completion not blocked)

üí° ADVISORY RECOMMENDATIONS:

While type safety is validated, lint issues are present. Consider:
1. Reviewing lint output for code quality improvements
2. Addressing lint issues to improve maintainability
3. Tracking lint trend for escalation if issues increase >20%

üìä COMPLETION CRITERIA STATUS:

‚úÖ Application typecheck: CLEAN (MANDATORY - SATISFIED)
