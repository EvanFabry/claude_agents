# Analytics Directory

This directory contains example analytics data generated by the Claude Code hooks system.

## Files

- **task_analytics.jsonl** - Example task analytics logs showing the structure and format of data collected by the analytics hooks

## Privacy Note

The included `task_analytics.jsonl` file contains example/test data from the original development environment. When you use this system in your own project, this directory will accumulate your project-specific analytics data.

## Usage

The analytics hooks automatically log:
- Task start/complete events
- Duration metrics
- Token usage statistics
- Tool call counts
- Session information

You can analyze this data using the observability scripts in `.claude/observability/`.

## Cleaning Up

You may want to:
1. Delete `task_analytics.jsonl` and start fresh with your own data
2. Add `.claude/hooks/analytics/*.jsonl` to your `.gitignore` to avoid committing analytics logs
3. Periodically clean old analytics files to manage disk space
